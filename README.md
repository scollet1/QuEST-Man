# QuEST-Man
Quick. and Easy. Source code. Task. Manager.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is literally just more motivation. Sometimes I'll begin developing an idea by opening a new repo and it's really difficult to actually start programming.
With this I hope to setup an automatic server or frequently manual tracker which runs locally and tracks total git contributions.
I hope to make it dynamic and intelligent enough to mitigate senseless quest requests, but, for example, if I'm not able to add any more lines of code to a project to fulfill a quest then that project *should* be completed, and thus QuEST-Man has fulfilled its duty.

## Goals:
 - [ ] every week provide a new quest to complete: i.e. commit this many times on a repo; write this many lines of code; etc.
 - [ ] monitor given quests on the changeover to a new quest
 - [ ] dynamically prioritize quests so that old quests are more likely to be completed
 - [ ] score the user and provide a simple UI to view progress
